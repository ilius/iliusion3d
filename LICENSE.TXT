Free Art License 1.3

[ Copyleft Attitude ]

Free Art License 1.3 (FAL 1.3)

Preamble
The Free Art licence authorises you to freely copy, spread, and transform creative works while respecting the author's rights.

Far from ignoring such rights, the Free Art License recognizes them and protects them. It reformulates their application byallowing each and every creative use of the mind's creation, regardless of their genres and the forms in which they are expressed.

While the application of copyright law commonly results in restricting the public's access to the mind's creation, the Free Art License facilitates. Its intent is to allow the use of the resources constitutive of a work; to enable new conditions for creation in order to amplify the possibilities of creation. The Free Art License allows enjoyment of works, while recognizing everyone's rights and responsibilities.

The invention and development of digital technologies, Internet and Free Software has changed the framework of creation: mind's creation can obviously be spread, exchanged, and transformed. They lend themselves favorably to producing common works that anyone can add to for the benefit of all.

It is the essential motivation for this Free Art License: to promote and protect these productions of the mind according to the principles of copyleft: freedom to use, to copy, to spread, to transform, and prohibition of exclusive appropriation.

Definitions

By "work" we mean either the initial work, the subsequent works or the common work as defined hereafter:

The common work: it is a work comprised of the initial work as well as all subsequent contributions to it (originals and copies). It is created on the initiative of the initial author who, by choosing this license, defines the conditions under which contributions are made.

The initial work: the work created by the initiator of the common work (as defined above), of which copies can be modified by whom wishes.

Subsequent works: contributions of authors who participate in the evolution of the common work by exercising the rights to reproduce, spread, and modify confered by the license.

Originals (sources or resources of the work): each dated copy of either the initial work or any subsequent work, that its authors present as reference for any subsequent updates, interpretations, copies or reproductions.

Copy: each reproduction of an original as defined by this license.

1. OBJECT
The aim of this license is to define the conditions under which you can freely enjoy this work.

2. EXTENT OF THE USAGE
This work is subject to copyright law, and the author, by this license, specifies the extent to which you can copy, spread, and modify it.

2.1 FREEDOM TO COPY (OR TO REPRODUCT)
You have the right to copy this work for you, for your friends or for any other person, by employing whatever technique you choose.

* spread the subsequent work under the same license or any compatible license.

The authors of the originals may, if they wish to, give you the right to modify the originals under the same conditions as the copies.

3. RELATED RIGHTS
No action confering either author's rights or related rights may interfere with the freedoms confered by this license.

This is why, for example, interpretations must be subject to the same license or a compatible license. Similarly, integrating the work in a database, a compilation or an anthology must not be an obstacle to the enjoyment of the work as defined in this license.

4. INCORPORATION OF THE WORK
Any incorporation of this work into a larger work not subject to the Free Art License must ensure full exercise of the rights confered by this license.

If the work cannot be accessed apart from the larger work incorporating it, then incorporation is only allowed under the condition that the larger work be subject either to the Free Art License or a compatible license.

5. COMPATIBILITY CRITERIA
A license is compatible with the Free Art License if, and only if:

* it gives the authorization to copy, spread, and modify copies of the work, including for commercial purposes, and without any other restrictions than those imposed by the observance of the other compatibility criteria;
* it ensures proper attribution of the work to its authors and access to previous versions of the work when possible;
* it recognizes the Free Art License as compatible (reciprocity);
* it prescribes that modifications to the work are subject either to the same license or to a license which also observes the present compatibility criteria.

The object of this license is neither to deny your author's rights on your contribution nor any related rights. By choosing to contribute to the evolution of this common work, you only agree to give others the same rights with regard to your contribution as those which were granted to you by this license. Giving these permissions does not require giving up your intellectual rights.

7. YOUR RESPONSABILITIES
